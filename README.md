# Win-winned

#### Just a bunch of random ideas I took from reddit or other OS and tried to get them on windows through rainmeter.

## TO DO
- [ ] Browser for Linux Bar
- [ ] Custom Skin Menu
- [ ] Being able to change element positions on the linux bar or turn them on/off
- [ ] Quick File Explorer
- [ ] A better dock than my previous one
- [ ] Winfetch without using terminal
- [ ] A custom start menu that opens instead of windows start menu when you click on home on bars
