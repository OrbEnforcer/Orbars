## TO DO
-  Browser for Windux Bar
-  ~~Custom Skin Menu~~
-  Being able to change element positions on the linux bar or turn them on/off
-  ~~A better dock than my previous one~~
-  Winfetch without using terminal
-  ~~A custom start menu that opens instead of windows start menu when you click on home on bars~~
-  ~~File Explorer for desktop~~
